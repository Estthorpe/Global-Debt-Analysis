# Global-Debt-Analysis
An analysis of the debt owed by different countries using the World Bank dataset
##Introduction: The "International Debt Analysis" project offers an exploration of global debt dynamics through meticulous SQL querying and compelling Power BI visualizations. By dissecting debt indicators and correlations, this project seeks to illuminate intricate economic relationships and trends that shape the international financial landscape.With a focus on data-driven insights, this analysis navigates through years of debt data, spotlighting key metrics that provide a comprehensive understanding of debt distribution and trends across various countries. By harnessing the potential of SQL and Power BI, this project aims to empower stakeholders with actionable insights, enabling informed decision-making in an interconnected world.
Join us in deciphering the story behind the numbers, as we transform raw data into strategic intelligence. Through this project, we present a dynamic showcase of technical acumen and analytical expertise, bridging the gap between data and actionable knowledge in the realm of international debt analysis.
The dataset is gotten from  World Bank: International Debt Data | Kaggle
